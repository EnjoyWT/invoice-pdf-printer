GNU Affero General Public License

Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                   Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure that
software licensed under it remains free, while also addressing the
problem of software used over a network.

When a user interacts with a program that is provided over a network,
they should have access to the source code of the program, just as if
they had received a copy of the program. This is what the Affero GPL
was designed to ensure.

The terms and conditions for copying, modifying, and distributing
the software are as follows:

                  TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
    License.
    "Copyright" means the legal right to copy, distribute, and modify
    the software.
    "You" means the licensee or the recipient of the software.
    "The Program" refers to the software or work that is licensed
    under this License.

  1. Source Code.
    The Program's source code must be made available to users under the
    same terms as the License itself.

  2. Copyleft.
    You may copy, modify, and distribute the Program, but you must
    release all modifications under the same AGPL license. This ensures
    that any derivative work remains free and open.

  3. Network Use.
    If you use the program over a network, you must provide the source
    code of the program to users who interact with it. This requirement
    is intended to address issues where a user is unable to access the
    source code of the program running on a remote server.

  4. Modification and Distribution.
    You may modify and distribute the Program under the terms of this
    License, but if you distribute the Program in any way (including
    via network access), you must provide recipients with access to the
    source code.

  5. Patent Grant.
    You must not use any patents or patent claims to restrict others'
    use of the software. If you distribute the software, you grant
    users a license to any patents you hold that are necessary for the
    use of the software.

  6. Tivoization.
    You may not impose restrictions on users that would prevent them
    from running modified versions of the Program, particularly in
    relation to hardware devices.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
    express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
    warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

  8. Termination.
    If you violate the terms of this License, your rights under it will
    be automatically terminated.

  9. Additional Terms.
    Additional terms or conditions may be applied, provided that they
    do not contradict the terms of this License.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
